# Experimental Social Board Game
An editable hexgrid with simple "marching-hex" algorithm is intended to act as an online boardgame for things like D&D. Pieces can be moved around by other players and seen in real time with websockets. A simple physics layer via Cannon.js is implemented and run locally for all pieces and somewhat haphazardly synced across players so things are mostly lined up. A simple chat system is in place with an image editor that allows drawing directly into chat. A very early attempt at making a D&D player card in vanilla.js is also available.
